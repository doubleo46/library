Coding style

When writing code please keep our style in mind:

Follow PEP8. There are some cases where we do not follow PEP8, but PEP8 is an excellent starting point.

Follow Django's coding style we're pretty much in agreement on Django style outlined there.

We enforce a few more strict guides not outlined by PEP8 or Django's coding style:

PEP8 tries to keep line length at 80 characters. We follow it when we can, but not when it makes a line harder to read.
It is okay to go a little bit over 80 characters if not breaking the line improves readability.

Use double quotes ("double quotes") not single quotes ('single quotes'). Single quotes are allowed in cases where a double quote is needed in the string. For example title = 'Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson'. We feel code reads cleaner in these situations.
Docstrings always use three double quotes on a line of their own, so, for example,
a single line docstring should take up three lines not one.

Imports are grouped specifically and ordered alphabetically.

Always use reverse and never @models.permalink.

URL patterns must use the path() and/or url() functions.

When callable arguments require multiple lines, place each argument on a new line,
indented four spaces from start of the function/method name.
