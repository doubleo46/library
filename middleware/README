This middleware is intended to avoid unautherised to access to webpages.
if we want to give access to certain pages we can define it in ''SAFE_TO_REDIRECT_URI_REGEX''
where each entry is the value of 'request.path' seperated by '|'.


Usage:
	1. Copy this folder to the root folder
	2. Add this middleware to settings
		'root_folder_name.middleware.HandleRequests'

You are good to go.

PS: 'admin_login' is a custom defined URL

	'/admin_login/' = request.path
	admin_login = name of the URL
